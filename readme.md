# Minified Calculators

A javascript calculator is one the basic projects you get given when you're learning. I tended to find them a bit boring so skipped them. I did think it would be intesting to try and make it in as small a file as possible. Apparently this is actually a thing called 'code golf', The things people who are good at that do are extremely impressive. I'm sure this has a lot more work and could be made even smaller.

## The two files
calc.html was my first attempt. It's actually more functional than than the second attempt but has a lot of work arounds like storing the last key as l, I think it was because eval() seems to work differently on the input field i I did in calc2. 

calc2 is much smaller. It annoys me I couldn't store s.value as a variable.
